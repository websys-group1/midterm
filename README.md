# midterm
For our website, one of our main focuses was revamping the css and html. We wanted a website that was going to be visually appealing to the audience, so we started off with an easy to read and straight forward landing page/sign in page. Each of our pages after the landing pae is formatted very similarly, and they all follow the same theme. In our posts.htmlpage, there are posts that the user can submit that appear on the homepage. Currently only our front end is working, so our submission page doesn't actually populate the page with a new post when you submit, but we have everything there to start coding for that in the future. On the posts pae we tried to use hover/animation effects when the user hovers over the post, and we tried to keep everything on that page cohesive. The submission page was done by paul, who used bootstrap to add some of its features. If the user forets to input something, the form will notify the user and ask then to fill in the field. The discussion page and some other general css was done by Lubna. The posts page and landing page was done by Chloe. All of the headers were formatted by rex, and he also made some css additions, as well as creating the power point.
